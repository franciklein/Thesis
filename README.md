# Thesis

## INTRODUCTION

The topic for my master’s thesis was born from an idea from my workplace. Currently I work as a technical writer for a multinational software company, SAP.

The company overall has more than a thousand technical writers, creating content every day. SAP has various products, each product storing their technical documentations in their preferred place and in preferred format, meeting their business needs.
This makes the company colourful and the products customizable, but at the same time it is hard to find the exact document if needed. So, a very relevant question popped up within the local technical writer team:

“Would it be possible to use a bot, to research through all of our technical documentation, and find the desired content in seconds?”

Motivated by this question, my master’s thesis will be researching the current possible solutions, the AI assistants dedicated to this application area. Exploring the pricing options, supported features of these tools, and comparing their performance and capabilities.

I will select the most suitable tools, and test them for different document resources, formats. Then I will analyse the results of the testing.
With the conclusion of my impressions of the existing tools, I will build my own model and test it with various inputs and criteria. With the results of the testing, I will make my conclusion and provide suggestions for solving the original problem of information extraction.

In summary, my tasks will look as follows:
- Creating document datasets of different sizes, topics, and structure for testing.
- Finding and getting to know several ML tools for information extraction.
- Determining the advantages and disadvantages of each tool.
- Building own model with the gathered information.
- Configuring and feeding the model with the datasets.
- Testing the information extraction accuracy of the tools.
- Writing recommendations for choosing the right tool for a given application.

The given application of the tested tools will be, to search and analyse Technical Documentations.
